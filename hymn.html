<h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
<p>My hope is built on nothing less<br>
than Jesus' blood and righteousness;<br>
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br>
I guess I must be having fun<br>
but wholly lean on Jesus' name.</p>

<h2>[Chorus]</h2>
<p>On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand:<br>
all other ground is sinking sand;<br>
all other ground is sinking sand;</p>

<h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
<p> When darkness veils his lovely face,<br>
I rest on his unchanging grace;<br>
in every high and stormy gale,<br>
my anchor holds within the veil.</p>

<h2>[Verse 3]</h2>
<p> His oath, his covenant, his blood,<br>
support me in the whelming flood;<br>
when all around my soul gives way,<br>
he then is all my hope and stay.</p>

<h2>[Verse 4]</h2>
<p> When he shall come with trumpet sound,<br>
O may I then in him be found:<br>
dressed in his righteousness alone,<br>
faultless to stand before the throne.</p>
